## Overview

**Laseroban** combines Sokoban-like mechanics with laser manipulation. Players progress from room to room, positioning cubes in ways that direct lasers toward targets. Completing all objectives in a room unlocks the next.

## Game Concept

- **Cube Manipulation**: Players can push and position cubes.
- **Laser Reflection**: Certain cubes can reflect lasers; aligning them correctly is essential to hitting the targets.
- **Room Progression**: Each room presents unique puzzles; all targets must be activated to proceed.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Puzzles become progressively more challenging as players advance.
